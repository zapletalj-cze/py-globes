# Polyhedral Globe Script Package

This script package addresses the creation of polyhedral globes in the form of a regular dodecahedron, resulting in an A2-sized PDF globe.

## Contents
- **main.py**: Converted set of Python blocks to py script, contains all Classes for projection handling, converted from MatLab

## Requirements
To run the script successfully, you need:

- Python version 3.11 distributed with ArcGIS Pro.
- ArcGIS Pro version 3.5.1.
- IDE installed
- One selected basemap from the available options.

## Installation and Execution
1. **Python Installation**: Ensure Python 3.11 is installed, distributed with ArcGIS Pro.
   
2. **ArcGIS Pro and Package**: Ensure ArcGIS Pro version 3.5.1 is installed.
   
3. **Running the Script**:
   - Open `main.ipynb` in VCS/Jupyter Notebook or `main.py` in any IDE
   - set globe scale, basemap, adjust layout size if needed
   - The result will be a generated PDF of the polyhedral globe in A2 format.
