# Polyhedral Globe Script Package

This script package addresses the creation of polyhedral globes in the form of a regular dodecahedron, resulting in an A2-sized PDF globe.

## Contents
- **main.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing all tools for user interaction.
- **tools.py**: Functions for creating datasets, defining projections, and composing layout (`projections` class), and composing layout (`layout` class)
- **face_definitions.py**: Defines individual faces coordinates and other attributes.

- Python version 3.11 distributed with ArcGIS Pro.
- ArcGIS Pro version 3.3.0.
- VCS or Jupyter Notebook installed
- Existing ArcGIS Pro project and workspace.
- One selected basemap from the available options.

## Installation and Execution
1. **Python Installation**: Ensure Python 3.11 is installed, distributed with ArcGIS Pro.
   
2. **ArcGIS Pro and Package**: Ensure ArcGIS Pro version 3.3.0 is installed.
   
3. **Running the Script**:
   - Open `main.ipynb` in VCS/Jupyter Notebook or `main.py` in any IDE
   - Execute each script as per the provided instructions.
   - The result will be a generated PDF of the polyhedral globe in A2 format.
